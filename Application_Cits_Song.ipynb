These differences originate from factors like atmospheric conditions, sun-target-sensor geometry, sensor calibration, soil moisture or vegetation phenology [ 4]. The signal attenuation due to atmospheric distortions has to be corrected image-wise to consider the specific conditions during image acquisition [ 9, **REF**]. In order to account for the sun-target-sensor geometry, topographic normalization can be applied to reduce spectral reflectance differences that occur due to the influence of terrain slope and aspect [ 11]. Although the reflectances of the images contributing to the cloud-free mosaic were corrected in two ways, the occurrence of different reflectances is still possible.\n",

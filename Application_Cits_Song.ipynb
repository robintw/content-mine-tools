      "In certain circumstances, radiance calibration of the image data is necessary prior to classification using multitemporal images [ 2]. The atmospheric effect can prevent the proper interpretation of images if it is not corrected [ 3]. For many other applications involving image classification and change detection, atmospheric correction is unnecessary for a single date image [ **REF**]. As long as the training data and images to be classified are on the same relative scale, atmospheric correction has little effect on classification accuracy [ 5, 6, 7]. Past investigators have used relative atmospheric correction techniques, which proceed on the assumption that a linear relationship exists between the measurements from a targeted area over time.\n",

These differences originate from factors like atmospheric conditions, sun-target-sensor geometry, sensor calibration, soil moisture or vegetation phenology [ 4]. The signal attenuation due to atmospheric distortions has to be corrected image-wise to consider the specific conditions during image acquisition [ 9, **REF**]. In order to account for the sun-target-sensor geometry, topographic normalization can be applied to reduce spectral reflectance differences that occur due to the influence of terrain slope and aspect [ 11]. Although the reflectances of the images contributing to the cloud-free mosaic were corrected in two ways, the occurrence of different reflectances is still possible.\n",

      "First, the reflectances were calculated from the digital numbers (namely the pixel gray-level values) of the different tiles and bands. Second, because of the time differences between the tiles, these values were calibrated to one another for each band to exclude atmospheric differences, using linear regressions based on the values from intersections of multiple tiles. According to Song et al. [ **REF**], no further atmospheric correction was performed. Third, the calibrated tiles were mosaicked and used to produce a raster of Qi et al.’s [ 32] MSAVI2 index, which is a spectral vegetation index that was invented especially to cope with soil noise. Furthermore, 6 rasters of texture parameters ( Table 1) that were calculated by applying a range filter of 3 × 3 pixels to the rasters of the spectral bands and the MSAVI2 were calculated.\n",

The method for atmospheric correction for bands 1-5 and 7 was adopted from Song et al. [ **REF**]. This simplified dark object subtraction method assumed no atmospheric transmittance loss and no diffuse downward radiation at the surface. The radiative transfer equation can be written as: (2) L a t − s e n s o r = L p + ρ F d T v π ( 1 − s ρ ) where L p is the path radiance, F d is the irradiance received at the surface, T v is the atmospheric transmittance from the target toward the sensor, s is the fraction of the upward radiation back-scattered by the atmosphere to the surface, and ρ is the surface reflectance.\n",

      "In certain circumstances, radiance calibration of the image data is necessary prior to classification using multitemporal images [ 2]. The atmospheric effect can prevent the proper interpretation of images if it is not corrected [ 3]. For many other applications involving image classification and change detection, atmospheric correction is unnecessary for a single date image [ **REF**]. As long as the training data and images to be classified are on the same relative scale, atmospheric correction has little effect on classification accuracy [ 5, 6, 7]. Past investigators have used relative atmospheric correction techniques, which proceed on the assumption that a linear relationship exists between the measurements from a targeted area over time.\n",

These differences originate from factors like atmospheric conditions, sun-target-sensor geometry, sensor calibration, soil moisture or vegetation phenology [ 4]. The signal attenuation due to atmospheric distortions has to be corrected image-wise to consider the specific conditions during image acquisition [ 9, **REF**]. In order to account for the sun-target-sensor geometry, topographic normalization can be applied to reduce spectral reflectance differences that occur due to the influence of terrain slope and aspect [ 11]. Although the reflectances of the images contributing to the cloud-free mosaic were corrected in two ways, the occurrence of different reflectances is still possible.\n",

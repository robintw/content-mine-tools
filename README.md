# content-mine-tools

This is a fairly rough-and-ready Python library for dealing with data produced by the [ContentMine](https://github.com/ContentMine/) set of tools
.

The only thing that is really ready to look at so far is [an example for finding citations to a specific paper](https://github.com/robintw/content-mine-tools/blob/master/Application_Cits_Song.ipynb),
but there is other functionality in the library, including searching and counting regexes.
